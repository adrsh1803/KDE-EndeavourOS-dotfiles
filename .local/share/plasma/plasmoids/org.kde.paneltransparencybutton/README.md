# How To Use

Add the button widget to your panel and activate it. Your panel will become completely transparent; just exit the panel configuration mode to hide the button.

# Install

This is a QML applet and as such it can be easily installed from Discover or the "Get New" applet in System Settings. Alternatively, you can execute `kpackagetool6 -i .` in the root directory of the applet.
